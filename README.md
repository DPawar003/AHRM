Smart Hydroponic System
Hydroponics is soil-less agriculture farming, which consumes less water and other resources as compared to traditional soil-based agriculture systems. However, monitoring hydroponics farming is challenging due to the simultaneous supervising of numerous parameters, nutrition suggestions, and plant diagnosis systems

OBJECTIVES
To be able to provide a better temperature for plants to grow.
To Control nutrient parameters in water.
To Design such an application, Give the user all information regarding temperature, nutrient composition, and recent crop conditions.
Components to Be Used:
Microcontroller (ESP32)
Air Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT 11)
Water Quality Sensor (TDS Sensor)
Water Temperature Sensor
Water PH Sensor
System Architecture

Tomato leaf Disease Detection in realtime

ADVANTAGES:
Real-time data analysis and monitoring.
Based on environmental parameters it will give readings accordingly.(for ex. Monitoring of temperature and humidity).
Reduces Manual efforts Automation of nutrient delivery, continuous monitoring and adjustment of environmental parameters, efficient resource utilization.
remote access and control for ease of management, and the potential for increased crop yields and quality through data-driven optimization.
User can monitor and manage Hydroponic System anytime and anywhere.
